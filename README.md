Queue Implementation Using Linked List (C)

This repository contains a C program that implements a queue using a linked list, focusing on the enqueue operation and the peek (front element) operation.

📌 Description

A queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
This program demonstrates how to implement a queue dynamically using a linked list, avoiding the limitations of fixed-size arrays.

The program:

Inserts elements into the queue using enqueue

Displays the front element using peek

🧠 How It Works

Each queue node is created dynamically using malloc

Two pointers (front and rear) are used to manage the queue

New elements are added at the rear

The front pointer always points to the first element

🛠️ Key Features

Queue implementation using linked list

Dynamic memory allocation

Enqueue operation

Peek (front element) operation

Simple and beginner-friendly C code
